# OutTheStory_Arabic
Arabic Version "Out of the Story" is a social deduction game where one player is secretly chosen as the imposter, while the other players are given a common word or theme related to a chosen category (like animals, fruits, or football players). The imposter doesnâ€™t know the word and must pretend to be part of the group while avoiding detection.
